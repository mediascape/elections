# WP3 Mediascape API #

This library is a compilation of different API's deffined for Mediascape project. The goal of MediaScape is to lay the foundations for interoperable technologies enabling the creation and execution of HTML5-based media services and applications that can be distributed seamlessly and in a simultaneous way across any type of connected device. The COPE –Create Once Publish Everywhere2   paradigm describes the main aim of MediaScape where applications created by developers are interoperable among the different technologies of the same type of device (e.g. different brands of Connected TV sets, radios, tablets, etc.) and dynamically adapt content and services to users’ particularities (preferences, type and number of simultaneous devices, network conditions, etc.). The convergence between the broadcasting sector, mainly based on audio-visual productions, and the Internet media sector, being much more service oriented, is also within the aims of MediaScape. This convergence will enable the integrated Multimedia Home where contents and services will be pervasively distributed and accessed.

The APIs that already have been included:

* Discovery API: This library build awareness about the device features and the available devices ready to be connected for each application instance. To achieve it, this *Discovery* library introspects the features of the device and detect the reachable devices through the possible network interfaces and communication protocols.
* Association API: The Association module is responsible of establish the communication mechanisms and protocols to perform the dynamic pairing of resources for a specific session.
